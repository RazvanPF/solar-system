# Solar System Explorer

Solar System Explorer is an interactive 2D web application that allows users to explore the solar system. The app provides detailed information about the Sun, planets, moons, and the asteroid belt, all presented with engaging visuals and a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Educational Solar System**:
  - Explore the solar system by clicking on celestial bodies to learn more about them.
  - Detailed descriptions include key facts such as age, mass, gravity, and atmospheric composition.

- **Sidebar Information Panel**:
  - A sidebar opens when a celestial body is selected, displaying relevant information and an image of the selected object.
  - The sidebar can be closed to return to the main view.

- **Hover Effects**:
  - Celestial bodies and moons have subtle hover effects, enhancing the interactive experience.
  - The selected body is highlighted with a "grow" effect to focus attention.

- **Starry Background**:
  - A dynamic starry background creates an immersive space environment with twinkling stars.

- **Explore in 3D**:
  - A link to explore the solar system in a 3D view is provided, offering a more immersive experience. The 3D view takes to the SOL system simulation which is a standalone version. For more solar systems visit the STAR CLUSTER (WIP) project here: https://github.com/RazvanPF/Star-Cluster

## How It Works

## Visual Design

- **Celestial Bodies**:
  - Each planet and moon is represented with an image. The Sun is prominently displayed as the first celestial body and then from left to right all planets in order. Below each planet , vertically listed their most known moons.
  - Special attention is given to size and scale, with larger celestial bodies like Jupiter and Saturn appearing more substantial.
